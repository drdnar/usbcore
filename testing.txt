Unit testing:
 - Init driver
 - TX buffer
 - RX buffer
 - USB event queue


Init driver
 - Seems to get things going


TX BUFFER: WORKS

Possible crashing issue?
NOT TESTED:
 - If you have less than DataSize bytes in buffer and size is not multiple of
   packet size, does it send a partial packet?

 - Flush buffer: WORKS
    - Should reset certain flags (TODO: Which?)
    - Should reset read ptr and write ptr
    - Should reset data size
 - Add byte: WORKS
    - Should reset buffer empty flag
    - Does not check DataSize var
    - WriteByteCount correctly returns delta between DataSize and bytes written
 - Remove byte: WORKS
    - Should set buffer empty flag if equals write ptr
    - Does not check DataSize var
    - ReadByteCount correctly returns delta between write and read ptrs
 - Continue TX: WORKS
    - Automatically breaks up TX into full and partial packets
 - Start TX: WORKS
    - Automatically starts TX


RX BUFFER: DOES NOT WORK
